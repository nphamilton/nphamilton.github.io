Hello and welcome to my website. Here, you can learn more about me and read some of my various musings on the research I am doing, the coffee I'm drinking, or the novels I'm reading. I'll try to post weekly, but I'm a grad student in their (hopefully) final year so my dissertation takes priority. The most recent post will be shown below and a record of all my posts can be found on the [Blog](https://nphamilton.github.io/blog.html) page.

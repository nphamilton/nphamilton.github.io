There is a new page to my website, [Cafe Reviews](nphamilton.github.io/cafe-reviews/), where I provide my reviews of the various cafes I have visted in Nashville. Once I am able to travel again, I plan to add reviews for cafes I visit when I travel. Hopefully I'll get a chance to visit many places and try all sorts of coffee. One of my dreams is to go back to Montreal and _not_ get Tim Hortons coffee like I did the last time I was there. I was naive and did not realize that such famous cafes like [Caf√© Myriade](https://cafemyriade.com/) and [Cafe Humble Lion](). It is one of my biggest regrets that I thought Tim Hortons was the pinnicle of good coffee while I was there. I promise that I have learned better since then.

In my cafe reviews I try to evaluate more than just the quality of the coffee served. I also rate food (if it is available) and the "vibe". For the vibe, I am looking for "How much would I enjoy spending a few hours here to write, work on homework, or meet up with a friend?"

In addition to this new page, with its beautiful table of results, I will be adding a section to my blog posts where I write about my experience at whichever cafe I visit that week. I do not always get a chance to visit a cafe each week, so it will not be a regular addition to my blog, but I will add them as I can.

I hope my reviews are helpful for any coffee enthusiasts reading my posts!

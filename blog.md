Hello and welcome to my blog. Here I have posts covering the wide variety of topics in my life. I'll cover topics from my research in Safe Reinforcement Learning, to the novels I'm reading, and the coffee I am drinking. At some point, when I've written more, I might try to categorize them so they can be grouped accordingly.

Please note that all the opinions shared in these posts are solely my ownand do not represent the opinions of any of my employers or research collaborators.

Hello! My name is Nathaniel Hamilton and I am a 5th year PhD student, now PhD Candidate, at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. I am a part of the [Verification and Validation for Intelligent and Trustworthy Autonomy Laboratory (VeriVITAL)](http://www.verivital.com/) headed by my advisor [Dr. Taylor T. Johnson](http://www.taylortjohnson.com/). My research focuses on training safer and more robust agents using Safe Reinforcement Learning. In particular, my current work focuses on developing a better understanding of how Safe Reinforcment Learning methods actually impact the training and performance of agents. 

My research branches across many robotics applications, with the greatest focus on:
1. autonomous racing with our lab's [F1/10](https://f1tenth.org/) race car,
2. various [aerospace tasks](https://github.com/act3-ace/SafeRL) using autonomous planes and spacecraft, and
3. autonomous search and rescue with a quadrotor for the [2018](https://cps-vo.org/group/arcompetitions) and [2019 NSF CPS Challenges](https://cps-vo.org/group/arcompetitions).

When I'm not reading research papers, writing code, or running experiments, I enjoy reading novels, brewing delicious specialty coffee, and/or getting outside for a long hike.
